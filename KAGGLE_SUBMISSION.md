# 📊 Apple Watch vs Fitbit: Comprehensive Wearable Data Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This professional data science portfolio project provides a complete analysis of Apple Watch and Fitbit fitness tracking devices. Using real-world health and activity data, we demonstrate end-to-end data science workflows including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** with 39 professional visualizations
- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing** (t-test, Mann-Whitney U, ANOVA)
- **Machine Learning Models** for regression and classification
- **Cross-Device Comparison** to identify device-specific patterns

## 📋 What's Inside

### 1. Data Exploration
- Demographic distributions by device
- Activity pattern analysis
- Health metrics comparison
- Correlation analysis

### 2. Statistical Analysis
- **H1**: Heart rate differences between devices
- **H2**: Step count variations
- **H3**: Calorie burn across activities (ANOVA)

### 3. Machine Learning

#### Regression (Calorie Prediction)
| Model | R² Score |
|-------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.85+ |
| Random Forest | 0.92+ |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.93+ |

#### Classification (Activity Recognition)
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 75%+ |
| Random Forest | 88%+ |
| Gradient Boosting | 89%+ |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 82%+ |

## 🔑 Key Findings

1. ✅ Both devices provide reliable fitness tracking data
2. ✅ Ensemble methods achieve R² > 0.90 for calorie prediction
3. ✅ Activity recognition accuracy exceeds 88%
4. ✅ Steps, heart rate, and distance are top predictive features
5. ✅ Cross-device modeling is feasible
