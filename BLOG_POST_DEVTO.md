# Apple Watch vs Fitbit: A Data Science Deep Dive

Ever wondered how accurate your fitness tracker really is? I analyzed **11,985 records** comparing Apple Watch and Fitbit to find out!

## TL;DR

- Both devices are reliable 
- ML models achieve **R² > 0.90** for calorie prediction
- Activity recognition hits **88%+ accuracy**
- **Steps, heart rate, distance** = top predictive features

---

## The Project

I built a complete data science pipeline:

```
Project Structure
├── apple.ipynb → Apple Watch analysis (71 cells)
├── fitbit.ipynb → Fitbit analysis (45 cells)
├── main.ipynb → Cross-device comparison (41 cells)
└── 39 visualizations 
```

**GitHub**: [Apple-Fitbit-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/NusratBegum/Apple-Fitbit-Data-Analysis)

## What I Analyzed

### 1. Statistical Testing

```python
# Hypothesis: Are heart rates different between devices?
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(apple_watch_hr, fitbit_hr)
# Result: p < 0.05 → Significant difference! 
```

### 2. Machine Learning

**Regression (Calorie Prediction)**:

| Model | R² Score |
|-------|----------|
| Linear Regression | 0.85 |
| Random Forest | 0.92 |
| Gradient Boosting | **0.93** |

**Classification (Activity Recognition)**:

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Random Forest | 88% |
| Gradient Boosting | **89%** |

## Quick Code Snippets

### Feature Importance

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Top features:
# 1. steps (0.28)
# 2. heart_rate (0.22)
# 3. calories (0.18)
```

### Correlation Heatmap

```python
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap='RdBu_r')
plt.title('Feature Correlations')
plt.show()
```
